# Auto-update pre-commit GitHub Action

A small [custom, composite GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) that is used by [ComPWA](https://github.com/ComPWA) repositories that pin constraints files (see [update-pip-constraints](https://github.com/ComPWA/update-pip-constraints)). The action is enforced in these repositories through [ComPWA/repo-maintenance](https://github.com/ComPWA/repo-maintenance).
